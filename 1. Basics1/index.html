    <!-- The placement of the <script> tag in an HTML document can vary depending on the specific needs of your webpage. Here are some general guidelines:

    Inside the head tag: You can place the <script> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document. This is typically where you would put scripts that need to load before the webpage’s content, such as libraries like jQuery.
    Inside the body tag: If your script needs to interact with the DOM elements on your page, it’s often a good idea to place your <script> tag just before the closing body tag. This ensures that all the HTML elements have loaded before your script runs.
    After the body tag: Placing the script tag after the body tag is generally not recommended. While it may work in some browsers due to error recovery, it won’t validate and could lead to unexpected results -->
